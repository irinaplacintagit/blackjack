#BLACK JACK CODING TEST
 
**Applicants are politely asked not to disseminate or discuss the details of this coding test to others.**

##THE BLACK JACK GAME
###DOMAIN MODEL
Blackjack is a game of cards using a standard deck of cards of 4 suits (**Hearts**, **Diamonds**, **Clubs** and **Spades**), each of which has the following cards (**2**, **3**, **4**, **5**, **6**, **7**, **8**, **9**, **10**, **Jack**, **Queen**, **King**, **Ace**), and a **Deck** of cards consists of one of each combination (2 of Hearts, 2 of Diamonds, 2 of Clubs, etc).

In the game Blackjack, the cards have the following values:

1. 2-10: The value of the card number.
2. Jack, Queen and King: 10.
3. Ace: 11. 

###GAME RULES
Assume there are 3 players. The aim of the game is to collect cards so that the total of an individual player’s cards does not exceed 21. At the end of the game the player with the total closest to 21 wins.

1.	At the start of the game, the deck is shuffled (i.e. the order of the cards is randomized) and each player is immediately dealt a “hand” of two cards from the top of the deck.

2.	Each player then takes turns to play. In a turn, the following rules apply:
	1.	If the player's total is less than 17, they **"hit"** (i.e. get dealt another card from the top of the deck).
	2.	If the player's total is 17 or greater, they **"stick"** (i.e. don't get dealt another card).
	3.	If the player's total is greater than 21, they **"go bust"** (i.e. are ejected from the game).

3.	The game finishes if:
	1.	All players "stick" in a round.
	2.	Any player hits 21 exactly.
	3.	There is only one player is left in the game because all others have "gone bust".

4.	At the end of the game, if the game has not finished due to a player hitting 21, the player with the total closest (but still under) 21 wins.

##CODING TEST

* Please progress through the following tasks and get as far as you can within 1.5 to 2 hours.
* We are interested in both Quality as well as Quantity - the quality of your solution is as important how far through the test you get.
* Your code should be as if you were developing this solution in a 'professional' environment. 
* Applicants are asked to follow the best practice they can in terms of creating their putative solutions.

###TASKS

1.	Make an account on bitbucket (it’s free) and **FORK** the bitbucket Blackjack-coding-test repository to make your own copy on which you will implement your solution.

2.	Using best Java development practice and appropriate language constructs, implement the domain model mentioned above. 

3.	Flesh out the skeleton application so that it plays a game of blackjack using the domain developed in stage 1, and 
	in accordance with the game rules stated above.
	1.	This should be runnable as a simple command line application.
	2.	The application should log the steps taken in the game by each player, as well as the results of their actions, to the console.
	3.	The application should finally state which player in the game is considered to have won to the console.

4.	Alter the application so that the number of players can be adjusted from a command line parameter. The number of players should be checked to make sure it is greater than 1, and less than or equal to 6. An error should be reported if this is not the case. The default for the application, if this parameter is not specified, should be considered to be 3.

5.	Add extra capability to the application so that a selection of different “shuffling” mechanisms can be chosen from a list of real-world algorithms (Riffle shuffle, Pharoah/Faro Shuffle, etc). The applicant is not requested to implement the detail of these different mechanisms, just adjust the application to allow the shuffling mechanism to be chosen at run-time.

6.	Add extra capability to the application so that the game rules can be altered so that the game being simulated (blackjack, poker, rummy) can be chosen at run-time from any game that is playable with a single deck of cards and 2 or more players.

7.	Finally, give us (**thomsonreuters**) access to your fork of the coding test (using Administration >> Access Management) so that we can review your solutions.
